#summary l1j-en is currently being revived

= Introduction =

l1j-en is currently being revived and brought back up to date.  I'll edit the other wiki pages later on, but since work is just now being started I made this new document to list my new goals.


= Goals =

 * bring l1j-en up to date to support the latest US live client.  Whatever US live dies with, I want l1j-en to 100% support, but I'm stopping there.  If we ever decide to go further and support clients from other areas I believe the project should be forked or maybe another branch started within this same project. So really this is an entire new page mainly just to make the point that I'm not going to be working on supporting asian clients, at least not with l1j-en anytime in the future.  With us live dying I think its a perfect opportunity to get l1j-en up to date, fully stable, and fully functional since we won't have to chase down new features with client updates ever again.
