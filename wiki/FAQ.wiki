== Introduction ==

This document is an in-progress collection of information about L1J-En.

== What are the goals of L1J-En? ==

In short, the primary goal of L1J-En is to create the most stable English language Lineage Server Emulator currently possible. The specific goals of the project are as follows, in descending order of priority:

1. Stability: The server should foremost be as stable as possible. By stability, we mean both that the server should be able to run as long as possible unattended and also that the gameplay should be as free of fundamental flaws as possible. The latest feature doesn't do a public server any good if it introduces dozens of bugs in the process or has the potential to unbalance a public server with an active playerbase. 

2. Fixing bugs: Non-functional or improperly functioning aspects of existing features takes precedence over adding new features. Bug fixing itself is prioritized by the effect it has on gameplay. 

3. Translation: Since this server is the only actively developed English language port of L1J, we'll do our best to translate all text content to English. This task is already completed for all existing aspects of the server.

4. New Features: We do want all of the latest new features worked on by the other various L1J projects. However, we take a more conservative approach with new features than other L1J ports, as they tend to be bug-prone when first added. We will also implement missing features ourselves as developer time permits. 

5. Server enhancements: Increasing the ease by which server admins can administrate their servers is a final goal. This includes custom settings, support for multiple OSes, GM/Monitor commands, stored procedures, and various other administrative functions. We also maintain an upgrade path for in-use databases.  

== What are NOT the goals of L1J-En? ==

There are several things that we could do, but won't for what we feel are valid reasons. A few of the major things we will not do are:

1. Refactoring the codebase: We are well aware of the fact that L1J is rife with lame technologies and very uninspired design. L1J is a great example of how NOT to design a large piece of software. While we share in the many complaints anyone with experience in software development will have within a few minutes of examining its architecture (or lack thereof), we will do as little refactoring as possible simply because we want to leverage the work being done by other L1J efforts. Diverging too far from their structure complicates the merge process, and while it would still be possible to make use of their additions, the English-speaking Lineage community lacks the talented manpower to re-implement every one of these individually. 

2. Support: While members of the development team do actively assist in the efforts of some of the public servers using the codebase, what we won't do is provide personal support for every person that downloads the code. The reason for this is simply that dev team members don't have time to provide individual walkthroughs of the setup process and all of the aspects of server administration. A setup guide is provided on this site, and support can be had from other admins and users on the LineageDC forum, however. We'll also do our best to make the various steps of the processes as self-explanatory as possible, but don't guarantee that it will be accessible to those who lack basic computer skills. 

3. Custom features: Many private servers provide a Lineage experience that has modified rules from the live servers. While we're happy to add any custom feature if it can be toggled with a configurable setting, what we won't do is modify the basic game mechanics of Lineage itself to satisfy one server's vision of what Lineage should be. Admins who want to do this are welcome to make their own private modifications, of course.

== I want to run the server, but am getting some error. What should I do? == 

First, ensure that you've read all documentation available here on the site. 95% of the time, the reason this occurs is because of some missed, ignored, or misinterpreted step that is already explained here. There is additional documentation available within the repository itself. The LineageDC site also has some information available. 

If still confused, scroll through some of the previous posts already made on the LineageDC forum. Chances are someone else has already made the same error you have and the answer is posted in a reply there. If you are unable to find an answer this way, feel free to post a question there. 

Lastly, if you're still having problems, and are either unable to explain it properly or get an answer from other users, you can always take a look at the code itself. Experience with most any higher-level programming language should be adequate to get an understanding of what should be occurring during server initialization. If the error is occurring at an earlier step, such as compilation or getting the server to start, documentation on the tool(s) you are using will probably provide the answer to what you're doing wrong. 

As previously mentioned in this document, what you should NOT do is track down and privately message a member of this team without invitation and expect them to drop whatever they are doing to help you. Unlike NCSoft's support team, this is not a job for us, but a volunteer effort. In the rare case where there has been a bad recent check-in that hasn't yet been caught, post the problem on the issues list with as much relevant detail as possible and someone will address it in the near future. 

== How do I report bugs? ==

There's a Issues tab on the site that is open to the general public to add bug reports. Create a new issue and fill out the form fields. Please add as much details as possible, so that whoever looks at it can recreate the bug in a test environment. Recreating the bug is almost always a necessary part of finding the bad code and fixing it. 

Bugs are prioritized by severity, but are not necessarily fixed in that order. If someone only has a few minutes of free time, they may just fix a smaller issue. Also, some issues are inherent to the current design, have client-related causes, or are otherwise impossible to resolve at the current time. These may linger indefinitely.

If there is a bug that really bothers you personally and it isn't being addressed quickly enough or to your satisfaction, remember that this is an open source project. We can and do accept fixes from non-members, and interested parties are welcome to join up and help. Remember, we're just fans of Lineage like yourself, who want to see Lineage emulation get better.
