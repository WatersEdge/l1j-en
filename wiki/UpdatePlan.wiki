#summary Plan and notes related to updating l1j-en.

= Aside =

Running this as a personal diary page isn't really in the spirit of wikis, but for the moment I think it's useful since it shows what's being pursued. Once we're up and running again this page can go to the digital void; anything useful can be moved to the faq.

= Introduction =

The l1j effort has been stagnant for awhile, but due to the increased interest in l1 private servers (and frankly, since I want some of the updates) there's interest in updating l1j-en.


= Details =

Several other l1j branches have been much better at keeping up with (not-so) recent client changes. l1j-jp2 and l1j-tw both seem to support at least 3.3, if not more recent clients. The short term goal is to get l1j-en back up to parity.

Things which would have to be done:
  * ~~Pick a branch of l1j to pull changes from - leaning towards l1j-jp2~~
  * ~~Setup machine to build and run server, and run backing database~~
  * Test server
    * Determine appropriate client
      * Get client
    * Determine how much needs to work before we start merging
  * Pull changes back to l1j-en & test
    * Probably try to merge stuff in chunks - while this might make for several revisions which couldn't be built, it avoids the Giant Revision of Doom.

Things which would be nice to do:
  * figure out a clean way of keeping multiple lineage clients installed at a time
  * translate some of the related pages for whichever l1j we use as a base. 

= In-Progress =

  * Using l1j-jp2 as a base. Have recent versions building, but need to get second box at home working before I can really test server. At least it builds and runs now.
  * Now talked to several older contributors and left messages for some others who (very probably) have done something similar to plan

= Tricids extra plans =

I hope its ok if we share this document, if not remove me, but I think its a good idea for a temporary list of ideas/plans for now.

  * I want user friendly install scripts for the server once we have it stable again.
  * An easy to maintain way to have branches/options within the code.  As an example if we have a maintainer from another server that wants to share his custom changes, with some config options and/or the install script, it can be optional to implement those changes, while keeping the more strict live like code in place as well.
  * A seperate tools directory that I'll be uploading soon that I wrote that helped me with the maintanance of this project.  They were mostly ruby scripts that helped me do database merges with l1j-jp and things of that nature
