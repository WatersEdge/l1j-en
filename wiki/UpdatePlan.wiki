#summary Plan and notes related to updating l1j-en.

= Introduction =

The l1j effort has been stagnant for awhile, but due to the increased interest in l1 private servers (and frankly, since I want some of the updates) there's interest in updating l1j-en.


= Details =

Several other l1j branches have been much better at keeping up with (not-so) recent client changes. l1j-jp2 and l1j-tw both seem to support at least 3.3, if not more recent clients. The short term goal is to get l1j-en back up to parity.

Things which would have to be done:
  * Pick a branch of l1j to pull changes from - leaning towards l1j-jp2
  * Determine exact client version compatible with current server and obtain a copy
  * Get base code up and running, ideally connecting to it with the appropriate client
  * Pull changes back to l1j-en & test

Things which would be nice to do:
  * figure out a clean way of keeping multiple lineage clients installed at a time
  * translate some of the related pages for whichever l1j we use as a base.
